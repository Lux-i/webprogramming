    "text":  "Hey, everyone, welcome back. You\u0027re now eight weeks into this JavaScript and TypeScript journey with us. Yeah. And this week, we\u0027re going to dive into how to make your web apps truly dynamic and interactive. Right. By connecting them to external data and services. Absolutely. Using APIs. APIs are everywhere. They are everywhere. And this is really exciting stuff because you\u0027re taking all those front-end skills you\u0027ve learned, and now you\u0027re going to learn how to connect at the back end. Yeah. So you can start building those... more complex real world apps that you\u0027re going to be working on. It\u0027s like the missing link. It is. It is. It\u0027s kind of like the glue that brings it all together. Exactly. And this deep dive is actually going to set us up really nicely for when we start learning Angular in the coming week. Oh, yeah, for sure. So I\u0027m excited to get into this. Me too. But before we go any further, I think it\u0027s important to kind of demystify this term API. Okay. Because I know when I first started learning about them, they sounded kind of scary. Yeah. So can you break it down for us? What exactly is an API? Absolutely. So API stands for application programming interface. OK. And basically, it\u0027s just a way for different applications to talk to each other. So you can think of it like a universal translator for software. I like that. Yeah. So, like, imagine you\u0027re building a weather app, right? Okay. You wouldn\u0027t want to go out and collect all the weather data yourself all over the world. That would be crazy. That\u0027s a lifetime project. Yeah, exactly. I\u0027d rather just relax on the beach. Exactly. So instead, you would use an API to connect to a service like, you know, weather underground or open weather map. And they already have all that data collected and organized. So my app could just say, hey, API, give me to weather for London. Exactly. And boom, it just appears in the app. Exactly. It handles all the hard work for you. That\u0027s pretty awesome. So APIs are all about leveraging these existing services to build richer web applications. E. But. but how do they actually work? Like, what\u0027s going on behind the scenes? Right. So most web APIs these days follow a set of rules called rest. Rest. Which stands for representational state transfer. Okay. Don\u0027t worry too much about the long name. Yeah. It\u0027s a mouthful. It is. But basically it just means that they use the familiar HTTP protocol, okay. Which is the same one that your browser uses to load web pages. Oh, wow. So it\u0027s like the same technology that powers. Paul connected. Cat Memes is also powering these complex web application. Yeah, it\u0027s all built on top of the same foundation. That\u0027s amazing. So. Yeah, and the cool thing about Rest APIs is that they use a very structured approach. Okay. They use different HTTP methods like get, post, put, and delete. Okay. To perform specific actions on data. Like verbs. Exactly, like verbs. You can think of them as the verbs in the API\u0027s language. Okay. So give me an example. Sure. So let\u0027s say you\u0027re building, um, You know that music streaming app we were talking about earlier? And a user searches for a specific song. Okay. Your app would send a get request to the Spotify API. Get request. Yeah, and be like, hey, Spotify, give me information about this song. Okay. And Spotify\u0027s API would respond with data about that song. Okay. Like the artist, the album, and a link to stream it. So it\u0027s like my app is having a conversation with the Spotify API. Exactly, like a back and forth. I like that. I ask for something and it gives me back what I need. It\u0027s all about communication. Okay, cool. So different actions in my app translate to different HTTP methods, and then the API in the other end knows how to handle each of those requests. It knows exactly what to do. That\u0027s pretty awesome. It is. It\u0027s a powerful system. Yeah. But how does TypeScript fit into all this? Ah, yes, TypeScript. We\u0027ve been learning TypeScript for a few weeks now. Right. And I\u0027m curious to see how it. enhances our API interactions. Well, TypeScript is all about type safety. Right. Remember all those times in JavaScript where you had to kind of guess what type of data you were dealing with? Oh, Oh yeah, and then it would cause all those weird errors. Exactly, and you\u0027d be scratching your head trying to figure out what went wrong. Debugging nightmares. Yeah, exactly. So with TypeScript, we can define the structure of the data we expect from the API up front using something called interfaces. Interfaces, okay. Yeah. So in our music app example, we could define an interface for a song. Exactly. That includes, you know, things like the title, the artist, the album duration. All those important details. And each of those would have a specific type like string or number. Right. And that way TypeScript can make sure that the data we receive from the API actually matches what we\u0027re expecting. Got it. So it prevents those nasty runtime surprises. Oh, so it\u0027s like TypeScript is acting as a guardian angel. Exactly. It\u0027s like a safety nut. It\u0027s making sure that the data flying between my app and the API is always in the correct format. Precisely. I\u0027m already feeling more confident about working with APIs knowing that TypeScript has my back. That\u0027s the power of TypeScript. It gives you that peace of mind. It really does. You can focus on building cool features without worrying about those low level type errors. Exactly. Well, this is all really fascinating. But before we dive deeper into the technical details of actually making those API calls, I\u0027d love to explore this concept of modular design. Oh, yes, modular design. It\u0027s a game changer. I\u0027ve heard it\u0027s like essential for building more complex application. Absolutely. But I\u0027m not really sure how it all works. Okay, so think of modular design, like building with Legos. Okay, I like Legos. Right. Each Lego brick is like a module. It has a specific object. purpose and function. Got it. And you can combine those bricks to build all sorts of amazing things. So instead of having one giant file with all my code. Yeah, that can get messy. Yeah, it can get really overwhelming. Very quickly. I can split it up into these smaller modules. Exactly. And then each module can kind of focus on one specific thing. Right. It\u0027s all about breaking down complexity into smaller manageable chunks. Okay, so going back to our music app example. We could have one module for handling all the HGI communication. Right. Another module for maybe like user authentication. Another module for displaying the user interface. Exactly. Each module will be like a self-contained unit with its own set of responsibilities. So they\u0027re like mini programs within my larger program. Yeah. That\u0027s a great way to think about it. Okay. And these modules, they can talk to each other. Yeah, they can communicate with each other in a very structured way. Okay. They can expose specific functions or data to other modules while keeping their internal workings hidden. Okay. So it\u0027s like they have their own little private space. That makes sense. It\u0027s like building a house. Yeah. You wouldn\u0027t try to build the entire thing all at once, right? Exactly. You\u0027d start with the foundation, then the walls, then the roof, and so on. Modular design is all about bringing that same level of organization and structure to software development. Okay. It makes your code more readable, more maintainable, and much more scalable. Especially as my application gets more and more complex. Yeah, as it grows, you\u0027ll be thankful you have that modular structure in place. This is really starting to make sense now. Good. I\u0027m really starting to see the power of combining APIs TypeScript. Mm-hmm. and this modular design. They all work together. To build these really robust and sophisticated web applications. It\u0027s like a recipe for success. It is. But how do we actually put all this theory into practice? Right. Let\u0027s get our hands dirty. Let\u0027s talk about the mechanics of actually making those API calls from our TypeScript code. Let\u0027s dive in. And excited. All right. So first, let\u0027s talk about fetching data using a get request, which is basically just like asking the API a question. I\u0027m ready to ask some questions. All right. Let\u0027s do it. So it\u0027s the most common way to retrieve information from an API. Okay. Let\u0027s say our user wants to see a list of all the available playlists in our music app. So our app would send a get request to a specific endpoint on Spotify\u0027s API. Yeah, it\u0027s basically just a URL that specifies where a particular resource is located. Okay, like a web address. Yeah, exactly. So it might be something like https.ap.ap.spotify.com full one playlists. Okay. Something like that. So it looks very similar to the URLs that we use to visit. web pages. Exactly. It\u0027s all based on those same web protocols. Oh cool. So... And just like a web page can return HTML, an API endpoint can return data in a different format like JSON. Jason. Okay, I remember that from my JavaScripters. Yeah, JavaScript object notation. It\u0027s a way to represent data in a structured way. Right, using key value pairs. Okay. Yeah, and it\u0027s super versatile. It can be simple text or really complex nested objects. So in this case, Spotify\u0027s API would send back a JSON response, containing information about all those available playlists. Okay, so it\u0027d be like a list of playlist objects. Exactly. Feach with, you know. Yeah, with all the details, like the name, the owner, the tracks in it. Okay, but my app is written in TypeScript. How do we bridge the gap between this JSON data? Ah, good question. And our TypeSafe code. Well, that\u0027s where TypeScript\u0027s interfaces come in handy. Okay. So remember how we talked about defining the exact structure that we expect for our data. Mm-hmm. We can create a playlist interface in TypeScript. Okay. That specifies the types for each property. Got it. So it might have a name property, which is a string. Okay. An owner property, which is also a string. Okay. And then maybe attracts property, which is... an array of song objects. Right. And so on. So TypeScript is like acting as a translator. Exactly. It makes sure that the JSON data conforms to our expectations when we receive it. That\u0027s really cool. So when we fetch the data from the API, we can use TypeScript to parse that JSON response and convert it into an array of playlist objects that our app can then easily work with. Okay, so if the API response doesn\u0027t match our interface, Ah, yes. TypeScript will let us know. TypeScript will raise a flag. It\u0027ll say, hey, something\u0027s not right here. Okay, so it prevents those weird bugs. Exactly. It helps us catch potential errors early on during development. Rather than having them pop up unexpectedly in production. Which is the worst time for a bug. Yeah, you don\u0027t want to be dealing with those. Not at all. So type safety is really one of the biggest benefits of using TypeScript for these API interactions. Yeah, it gives you that peace of mind. Right. You know, the data you\u0027re working with is what you expect it to be. Is in the correct format. Yeah, it\u0027s not going to cause those weird errors. Exactly. All right, so fetching data with a get request, that\u0027s pretty straightforward. Yeah, I think I\u0027ve got that. But what about sending data to the API? Okay. Like let\u0027s say our user wants to create a new playlist. Okay. What do we do then? I don\u0027t know. Well, that\u0027s where post requests come in. Post requests. Yeah, instead of just retrieving data, we\u0027re actually sending new data to the server. Interesting, okay. So we\u0027re making changes to the data on the server. Okay. So we would still use something like the fetch function to make the API call, but this time we would specify post as the HTTP method. Okay, so instead of get its post? Yeah, exactly. And then what happens? Well, in addition to the endpoint URL, we would also include a body in the request. A body. Yeah, the body contains the data that we want to send to the API. Okay, so in this case, it would be the data for the new playlist. Exactly. It would include things like the playlist name, maybe a description, any initial tracks we want to add, and so on. And that would be formatted as JSON? Typically, yes. Okay, so we would define an interface for playlist. Right. Create a playlist object in our typescript code. Mm-hmm. And then send it to the API. Using a post request. Exactly. Okay. And of course we\u0027d need to consult Spotify\u0027s API documentation. Right. To see exactly what endpoint and what data format they expect for creating a playlist. Like it says, each API is a little bit different. Yeah, they all have their own conventions. So it\u0027s important to read the docs. Always read the docs. Okay. But what if something goes wrong? Oh. During this whole API communication process, Yeah, good question. What if the network is down or the API server is having a bad day? Yeah, that can happen. Yeah, it does happen. So that\u0027s where error handling comes in. Error handling, okay. We can\u0027t just assume that our API calls will always be successful. Right. So we need to gracefully handle those potential errors. So how do we do that? Well, one way is to wrap our API calls in a try. Dot catch block. Try to catch, okay. So if the API request succeeds, our code within the try block will execute as normal. But if there\u0027s an error, like a network issue, or the server returns an error resource, the catch block will be triggered. And that gives us a chance to handle that error gracefully. So we could maybe display an error message to the user? Exactly. Or we could try to retry the request. Or maybe log the error for debugging purposes. It really depends on the situation. So it\u0027s like having a backup plan. Yeah, exactly. It\u0027s all about creating a smooth and resilient user experience. Yeah. Even when things go wrong. Even when we\u0027re dealing with those unpredictable networks. Yeah, networks are tricky. Yeah, and APIs. Exactly. So we\u0027ve covered fetching data, sending data, and error handling. That\u0027s a lot. It is, but there\u0027s one more important aspect that we need to talk about. Okay. What\u0027s that? Authentication. Authentication, okay. How do we make sure that only authorized users can access and manipulate data through our app? Yeah, that sounds important, especially when we\u0027re dealing with like, you know, you know sensitive data sensitive user data like playlist and listening history absolutely we don\u0027t want just anyone messing with that not at all so there are different approaches to authentication but a common one is using API tokens API tokens okay yeah so when a user logs into our app Spotify would generate a unique token for that user okay and our app would then include that token in every API request it makes as a way of saying, hey, this request is coming from a trusted source. So it\u0027s like a digital badge that gives my app permission to access certain things. That\u0027s a great way to think about it. Okay. Spotify\u0027s API would then check this token on each request. Okay. To verify that it\u0027s valid and to see what the user\u0027s allowed to do. Got it. So if someone tries to make a request without a token or tries to do something they shouldn\u0027t be doing, the API will reject that request. So it\u0027s like a security guard? Yeah. Protecting our data. Yeah, making sure that only the right people get in. Exactly. It\u0027s all about security. Okay, cool. So authentication can get pretty complex? It can, yeah. But the good news is there are libraries and tools that can help handle a lot of that complexity for us. Oh, that\u0027s good to hear. So we don\u0027t have to reinvent the wheel every time. Exactly. Well, we\u0027ve covered a lot of ground today. We have. We talked about fetching data, sending data error handling. and now even authentication. It\u0027s a lot to take in. I\u0027m starting to feel like I could actually build something real with all this knowledge. That\u0027s the goal. Yeah, I\u0027m really excited to dive into that hands-on exercise. Oh, yeah. That\u0027s going to be fun. Where we get to actually build a music app front end. Yeah, you\u0027ll get to see all these concepts in action. Yeah, and connect it to a mock API. It\u0027ll give you a real taste of how these things work in the real world. I can\u0027t wait. But before we wrap up, I\u0027d love to get your advice on some tools and resources for someone just starting out with APIs and TypeScript. Yeah, good question. So first off, a good code editor is essential, like Visual Studio Code. Yeah, VS code is my go-to. It\u0027s awesome. It has great... great TypeScript support, built-in debugging tools, and tons of extensions. Yeah, I love the extensions. Okay, so VS code is among a half. Definitely. And then for making those API calls, there are a few popular libraries out there. Okay. Like Fetch, which is built into most modern browsers. Okay. Axios, which is known for its ease of use, and Super Agent, which offers some more advanced features. So it\u0027s like picking the right tool for the job. Yeah, exactly. Some are more lightweight, while others offer more power and flexibility. Right. It really depends on your needs. Okay, and what about just like general learning resources? Well, the official TypeScript documentation is a great place to start. Okay. They have really good tutorials and examples. Okay. And then, of course, the API documentation for whatever service you\u0027re using. Right, Spotify in our case? Exactly. They\u0027ll tell you everything you need to know about how to interact with their API. Makes sense. And then there are tons of... blog posts, tutorials, and online courses out there. Yeah, the internet is a treasure trove of information. It really is. So, yeah, don\u0027t be afraid to Google things. Yeah, and ask questions. Yeah, the developer community is super helpful. Yeah, everyone\u0027s always willing to lend a hand. It\u0027s one of the best things about being a developer. Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, this has been an incredible deep dive. It has been fun. I feel like I\u0027ve learned so much. I\u0027m glad to hear that. I\u0027m excited to start building my own API-powered applications. Awesome. Remember the possibilities are endless. I can\u0027t wait to explore them. And to all our listeners out there, keep coding, keep learning, keep learning. And keep building those amazing web experiences. We\u0027ll catch you in the next.",
