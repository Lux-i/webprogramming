    "text":  "All right, welcome back. We\u0027re diving into week three of JavaScript and TypeScript. Yeah. You\u0027re really starting to build on those web dev skills. Yeah, you already know HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and PHP. Okay. And now it\u0027s time for JavaScript and TypeScript. That\u0027s right. So in this deep dive, we\u0027re going to make sure that JavaScript arrays and loops become your new best friends. Yeah. Especially for that memory game project that\u0027s coming out. Yeah. Arrays and loops, they\u0027re like so essential. They really are. I mean, for that memory game, you\u0027re going to need them. Yeah. I remember when I first started learning to code. Uh-huh. loops, oh loops, which is like, what is this? Yeah, I know, they\u0027re kind of tricky at first. I would get so frustrated. I\u0027d just be staring at the screen. Like how, why is this not working? Right. And then when you finally figure it out, it\u0027s like, The best feeling. It\u0027s like, oh, I get it now. Total aha moment. So let\u0027s get started with arrays. Okay, so imagine you\u0027re building this memory game, right? You got all these different cards, each with their own unique symbol. Yeah. How are you going to keep track of all those cards in your code? Hmm. That\u0027s a good point. How would you do that? Well, you could create like a separate variable for every single card, but that\u0027s going to get messy, super fast. Yeah, that does not sound very efficient. Right. So that\u0027s where arrays come in. They\u0027re like these nicely organized little containers that you can put all your data in. So kind of like a list. Exactly, like a numbered list in your code. But instead of bullet points, you use square brackets. Okay. And then inside those brackets, you list out all your data separated by commas. I see. So for your memory game, your array might look something like this. Right. Open square bracket, heart, comma, star, comma, diamond. Okay. comma, club, comma, heart, star, diamond, comma, club, square bracket. Okay, so that\u0027s way better than having all those separate variables. Right. But you said it\u0027s like a numbered list. So does that mean that we can actually access each card individually? You got it. And this is where it gets interesting, because computers, they start counting from zero. Okay. So to access that first card, that heart, you would use the index zero. Okay. Like this. Cards. open square bracket, zero, closed square bracket. I see. To access the second card, the star, you\u0027d use cards, open square bracket, one closed score bracket, and so on. That makes sense. So if I wanted to check if two cards in my game match, I could use these indexes to like grab the symbol from the array and compare them. Exactly. So you\u0027re already thinking like a programmer. And speaking of checking things, there\u0027s a super handy tool in JavaScript. Okay. It\u0027s called console.log. Console.org. Yeah. And it\u0027s basically a way to like peek inside your code and see what\u0027s going on. Oh, okay. So if you wanted to see what\u0027s stored in that cards array, You could just type console.log, open parenthesis, cards, close parenthesis, and it would spit out that whole array right into your browser\u0027s console. That sounds really useful, especially for debugging. It\u0027s a lifesaver. I use it all the time. But arrays by themselves, they seem a bit static, right? Hmm. Yeah, like, how do we make them do things? You know, how do it make them shuffle the cards for the game? You\u0027re right. And that\u0027s where these things called array methods come in. Array methods. Yeah, they\u0027re these built-in functions that let you do all sorts of cool stuff with your arrays. Like shuffling. Like shuffling. For shuffling, there\u0027s not like a specific shuffle method. Okay. But we can use a bunch of other methods to get the job done. Okay. But first, let\u0027s look at some of the basic ones, like push, pop, shift, and unshift. Push, pop, shift, unshift. All right, what can we do with those? Okay, so imagine your cards array is like a deck of cards. Okay, a deck of cards. Push lets you add a new card to the top of that deck. Okay. So, cards. Dot push, open parenthesis, spade, close parenthesis, would add that spade to the end of your array. Goop. Pop, on the other hand. Okay. that removes the top card. So, cards dot pop, open parenthesis, close parenthesis, would remove the spade from the end. Okay. So push adds to the end, pop removes from the end. Got it. Right. So you see how that could be helpful for like adding or removing cards as the game goes on. Yeah, definitely. What about shift and unshift? Okay, think of those as like operating on the bottom of the deck. The bottom. Yeah, so un- unshift adds a card to the beginning of your array, like sliding it under the bottom of the deck, and then shift removes that first card. Okay, so we\u0027ve got ways to add and remove cards. But how do we shuffle them? You know, like really mix them up. Right. And like I said, there\u0027s no single shuffle method, but we can get clever and use a combo of loops. Okay. And the methods we just learned to do it, loops, they let us repeat instructions over and over. So they\u0027re perfect for something like shuffling. I\u0027m starting to see how this all comes together. So tell me about these loops, what kinds of loops are there, and how do the work? All right, let\u0027s get loopy. In JavaScript, we\u0027ve got a few different types of loops. four while and four each. So like different tools for different situations, when would you use one over another? Yeah, exactly. Let\u0027s start with four each. It\u0027s really great when you need to do something to every single element in an array. Okay. So think about it, like you want to lay out all the cards for your memory game face down. Yeah. Instead of writing code to place each card individually, you could use four each to go through that array and place each one. Oh, that sounds much easier. Can you give me an example of how that would look in code? Absolutely. So let\u0027s say your card array is named cards. Right. You could use a for each loop like this. Cards.4 each, open parenthesis, card equals sign, greater than open curly brace, close curly brace, semicolon. Okay. And then inside those curly braces, that\u0027s where you put the code to actually create and display the card element on the board using that card variable. So the for each loop goes through each element in the cards array. And for each one, it does whatever is in the curly braces. Yes. Yes. You got it. That card variable inside the loop, that represents the current card being processed. Got it. So you can use that variable to get like the card symbol and other information you need to create it on the game board. Okay, that makes sense. But what if I need to be more specific? Okay. Like what if I want to loop a certain number of times to, I don\u0027t know, Create the grid for the game board. Ah. Okay. So in that case, you\u0027d use a for loop. A four loop. Yeah. It\u0027s like the workhorse loop. Okay. You can control exactly how many times it runs. Right. And it has a very specific structure, initialization, condition, and increment. That sounds a little intimidating. Can you break that down a bit more? Yeah, of course. Let\u0027s say you want to create a 4x4 grid for your memory game, which means you need 16 card slots, right? Right, 16. So you could use a 4 loop for that. It\u0027ll look like this. 4. Open parenthesis, let. space, i space equal sign, space zero, semicolon, space, i space less than space 16, semicolon, space, i plus, plus close parenthesis, space, open curly brace and close curly brace. Okay, so letter i zero though, that creates a counter variable called i. Right. Then i less than 16, that\u0027s checking if i is less than 16. Exactly. That\u0027s the condition. Plus increases the cater each time. Yes. Every time the loop runs. So it runs 16 times. Yes, exactly. Creating each card slot on the board. You got it. This is making sense. Yes. But what if you don\u0027t know exactly how many times you needed to run? Okay. Like maybe the game keeps going until all the matches are found. Ah, that\u0027s a great question. So for that. we would use a while loop. A while loop. Yeah, it\u0027s a loop that keeps going as long as a certain condition is true. So it\u0027s kind of like saying keep doing this until something happened. Exactly. So in your memory game, you could use a while loop to keep checking if all the matches have been found. And the loop would just keep running until all the cards are matched and then it stops. How do you make sure it doesn\u0027t run forever? That sounds like it could crash things. You\u0027re right. You\u0027ve got to be careful with while loops. You have to make sure that the condition you\u0027re checking will eventually become false. Right. Otherwise, yeah, you get the infinite loop and your browser is going to be like, whoa, what\u0027s going on here? Yeah, not good. It\u0027s not good. So I think I\u0027m starting to see how all these pieces fit together, the arrays, the loops, all that. But how do we actually put it all together? Like, how do those work together to make the actual game logic work? So we\u0027ve got these arrays holding all our card data and the loops that can do things with that data. But how do we actually like connect everything and make the game actually work? It\u0027s all about strategy. Okay. We need to use the right tools at the right time. Okay. So let\u0027s break it down. Like let\u0027s go through some of the main parts of the game. Okay. And see how we can use arrays and loops to make them work. Where do we even begin? Well, at the very beginning, we need to shuffle those cards, right? Yeah, we got to mix them up. Right. And that\u0027s where a loop comes in. Okay. We can use a four loop to go through our card array and swap each card with another card at a random position. So the loop is like our dealer shuffling the deck before the game starts. Perfect analogy. What happens when a player clicks on a card? Ah, then we need to keep track of which cards are flipped over. Okay. And we can use an array for that too. Another array. Yeah, to store the currently flipped cards. Okay. So when the player clicks a card, we add that card to the flipped cards array. Mm-hmm. And then we use a loop to check if there are two cards in that array. If there are two, then we compare them. Right. We see if they match. And if they do. It\u0027s a point for the player. What if they don\u0027t match? Then we use a little timeout, you know, maybe like half a second or so. Yeah, just let the player see both cards. Exactly. And then we can use those array methods we talked about earlier, like pop or shift to remove those mismatched cards from the flipped cards array and flip them back over on the game board. Got it. So we\u0027re using arrays to keep track of what\u0027s happening in the game and loops to like manage the actions based on that? Exactly. You\u0027re getting it. What about the reset button? How does that work with rays and loops? Okay. So when the player hits reset, we basically want to like start the whole game over. Right. Clear the board, shuffle everything again. Right. So for clearing the board, we can use a loop to remove each card element from the display. Okay. Remember all that DOM manipulation stuff you\u0027ve been learning? Yeah, yeah. This is where that comes in handy. Right. So we can actually target the HTML elements for the cards. and use JavaScript to get rid of them. Exactly. And then we can use our trusty shuffle function again with its loop-powered swapping. You can mix up the cards. Yep. Randomize everything. And then finally, we use another loop to recreate and display all those card elements back on the board using the newly shuffled array. This is really starting to click now. Seeing how arrays and loops fit into each part of the game is super helpful. I\u0027m glad to hear that. And, you know, once you understand the basics, you can get really creative and add all sorts of cool features. Oh, yeah. Like what? Well, for example, you could use arrays and loops to create different difficulty levels. Oh, that\u0027s a cool idea. How would you do that? You could have an array that stores different difficulty settings, like the number of cards, the layout of the grid, maybe even a timer. And then when the player chooses a difficulty? Yeah, we use a lute to adjust the game based on that choice. So for harder difficulty, the loop could add more cards to the array, make a bigger grid, even speed up the timer. Exactly. You could even use arrays and loops to keep track of the player\u0027s score and like display a leaderboard. The possibilities are pretty much endless. This has been such a great deep dive. We\u0027ve covered so much like how arrays and loops work, how to use them in a real project like the memory game. And we even brainstorm some cool features we could add. Yeah, it\u0027s been fun. And, you know, the key takeaway here is to just keep practicing. Practice, practice, practice. Yeah, and don\u0027t be afraid to experiment, break things, try new stuff. The more you work with arrays and loops, the more comfortable you\u0027ll become. And trust me, you\u0027re going to make mistakes along the way. Oh, for sure. But that\u0027s totally okay. That\u0027s how we learn. That\u0027s how we all get better. Absolutely. So to all our listeners out there, keep coding, keep experimenting, and most importantly, have fun with it. We\u0027ll catch you in the next deep dive.",
